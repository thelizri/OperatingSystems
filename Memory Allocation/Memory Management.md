## Memory Hierarchy and CPU Access
### Main Memory and Registers
- **Direct CPU Access**: Both main memory and registers are directly accessible by the CPU.
- **Registers**: These are the fastest memory components, located in the CPU and used for immediate operations.

### Cache Memory
- **Location**: Cache memory is positioned between main memory and CPU registers.
- **Function**: It speeds up access to frequently used data by reducing the time required to fetch data from the main memory.

## Address Protection
### Protecting System and Processes
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to prevent user processes from accessing and potentially disrupting the operating system's memory.
- **Hardware-Based Protection**: This safeguard is implemented at the hardware level.
- **Memory Space Allocation**: Each process is given its own distinct memory space, controlled by the hardware to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Base and Limit Registers
- **Role**: These registers define a process's logical address space.
- **Base Register**: Holds the smallest legal physical memory address.
- **Limit Register**: Specifies the size of the addressable memory range.

---

## Hardware Address Protection
- **Address Validation**: The hardware validates whether a process's generated addresses fall within the specified base and limit range.
- **Error Handling**: Any address outside this range triggers an exception to prevent illegal memory access.

## Address Binding
### Types of Address Binding
1. **Compile-Time**: Generates absolute code with physical addresses when memory locations are known in advance.
2. **Load-Time**: Produces relocatable code if memory locations are unknown at compile time.
3. **Execution Time**: Binds addresses during program execution, supporting dynamic memory allocation.

## Linking and Loading
### Static Linking
- **Process**: System libraries and program code are merged into a single binary image during the loading phase.

### Dynamic Linking and Loading
- **Dynamic Linking**: Libraries and program modules are linked during runtime.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Program components are loaded and linked as needed, optimizing memory usage.

## Logical and Physical Address Space
### Logical Address Space
- **Description**: Represents the memory view from the process’s perspective, generated by the CPU.

### Physical Address Space
- **Description**: The actual memory addresses in the system’s memory.

### Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- **Function**: Maps logical addresses to physical addresses using mechanisms like a relocation register.

---

## Memory Allocation Strategies
### Contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Method**: Memory is divided into partitions of fixed or variable sizes.
- **Process Isolation**: Each partition hosts a single process, with relocation registers ensuring protection and address mapping.

### Allocating Memory with Holes
- **Strategy**: Utilizes methods like First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, Next-Fit, or Quick-Fit to allocate memory in a fragmented system, based on specific system requirements.

---

## Memory Fragmentation
### External Fragmentation
- **Issue**: The total memory space is sufficient for a request but is noncontiguous.
- **Solution**: Allowing noncontiguous memory allocation.

### Internal Fragmentation
- **Description**: Occurs when allocated memory is slightly larger than the requested memory.

---

## Segmentation
- **Concept**: A program is viewed as a collection of segments like main programs, procedures, functions, objects, etc.
- **Address Structure**: Logical addresses are composed of a tuple: (segment_number, offset).
