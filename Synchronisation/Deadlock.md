## Definition of Deadlock
A deadlock in an operating system is a state where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for resources to be released by the others. In this situation, the involved processes are stuck indefinitely, leading to resource wastage and impacting system efficiency and reliability.

## Deadlock System Model
- **Resources**: The system consists of `m` different resources (R1, R2, ..., Rm), such as CPU cycles, memory space, and I/O devices.
- **Resource Instances**: Each resource type `Ri` has `Wi` instances.
- **Resource Utilization Process**: Each process interacts with resources in three phases:
  - **Request**: The process requests the resource.
  - **Use**: The resource is used by the process.
  - **Release**: The resource is released by the process.

## Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
Four conditions must be present simultaneously for a deadlock to occur:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can use a resource at a time. Other processes must wait until the resource is released.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holding at least one resource waits to acquire more resources held by others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes; they must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: There exists a set of processes {P1, P2, ..., Pn} where each process Pi is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the set, forming a circular chain.

## Handling Deadlocks
Operating systems handle deadlocks using various strategies:

1. **Deadlock Prevention**: Modify system operations to prevent one or more of the four conditions:
   - **Mutual Exclusion**: Not required for shareable resources (e.g., read-only files). Necessary for non-shareable resources.
   - **Hold and Wait**: Ensure a process either requests all resources at once or releases them before requesting new ones.
   - **No Preemption**: Allow preemption of resources if a process requests a new resource and cannot be immediately allocated.
   - **Circular Wait**: Impose an ordering of resource types and require processes to request resources in this set order.

2. **Deadlock Avoidance**: Dynamically check the resource-allocation state to avoid circular waits, often using algorithms like the Banker's algorithm.
   - **Safe State**: A state where resources can be allocated to each process in some order without causing a deadlock.

3. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery**: Detect deadlocks when they occur and recover, usually by terminating processes or preempting resources.

4. **Deadlock Ignorance**: In some systems, deadlocks are ignored, assuming they are rare and not worth the overhead of prevention or detection.

## Resource Allocation Graph
The Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) is crucial for understanding and detecting deadlocks in a system. It visually maps how resources are allocated to processes and how processes request resources. Key concepts include:

- **Claim Edge (Pi â†’ Rj)**: Symbolizes potential requests by process Pi for resource Rj. Illustrated as a dashed line. It transforms into a request edge when Pi actually requests Rj.
- **Transformation of Edges**: When Pi requests Rj, the claim edge becomes a request edge. Upon allocation of Rj to Pi, this edge becomes an assignment edge. Releasing Rj by Pi turns the assignment edge back into a claim edge.
- **Pre-Claiming of Resources**: Resources must be claimed in advance in the system.

For deadlock detection, a crucial rule is that a request from Pi for Rj can only be granted if it doesn't lead to a cycle in the RAG.

## Safe State
A state is considered safe if there's a sequence of all processes (P1, P2, ..., Pn) where each process Pi's remaining resource requests can be met by:
- The currently available resources, plus
- The resources held by all processes Pj, with j < i.

In assessing requests:
- If Pi's resource needs are immediately met, the system must check if allocating these resources keeps the system in a safe state.
- If resources aren't immediately available, Pi waits. Once all Pj have finished and released resources, Pi can proceed, execute, and eventually terminate.
- Following Pi's termination, Pi+1 can then proceed in a similar manner.

This framework helps in managing resources to avoid deadlocks, ensuring that processes can be carried out in an order that maintains system stability and efficiency.

## Deadlock Avoidance: Banker's Algorithm

#### Overview
The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance strategy that ensures the system remains in a safe state after resource allocation to any process. It operates on the principle of simulating allocations and checking for safe states before actual resource allocation.

#### Key Terms
- **Available**: This is the pool of resources currently available to allocate. Calculated as Total Resources minus Total Allocations.
- **Max**: The maximum resources a process might need to complete its execution.
- **Allocation**: The resources currently being used by a process.
- **Need**: The additional resources a process may need to complete its task, computed as Max minus Allocation.

#### Banker's Algorithm: Step-by-Step Process
1. **Initial Setup**: Determine the 'Need' for each process, calculated as the difference between its maximum resource requirement and its current allocation.
2. **Resource Request Handling**: Upon a resource request by a process, the system tentatively assigns the requested resources for simulation purposes.
3. **Safety Assessment**: The request is compared with the available resources. If the 'Need' of a process is less than or equal to the 'Available' resources, the process is tentatively allowed to proceed, complete its tasks, and release resources.
4. **Granting or Denying Requests**:
   - If this tentative allocation maintains a safe state, the resource request is officially granted.
   - If the allocation could lead to an unsafe state, the process is made to wait, and the tentative allocation is not made permanent.
5. **Release of Resources**: When a process finishes execution, it releases its allocated resources, which are then returned to the pool of available resources, ready for re-allocation.

## Summary
Deadlocks occur due to mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait. They can be managed through prevention, avoidance (with algorithms like the Banker's algorithm), detection, and recovery strategies.
