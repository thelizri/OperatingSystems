# [[Abstraction]]
- Hides details of different hardware configurations
- Applications don't need to be tailored for each possible device that might be present on a system

# Arbitration
- Manages access to shared hardware resources
- Enables multiple applications to share the same hardware simultaneously
- Schedules programs
- Manages resources

# Layers of the System
1. Applications
2. Libraries and Utilities
3. Operating System
4. Hardware

# Hardware Software Interface
- Operating System implements a common mechanism for allowing applications to access and share hardware
- Applications can make requests from the operating system via system calls
- Operating System can deliver hardware events to applications

# Three Easy Pieces
1. Virtualisation
2. Concurrency
3. Persistance
