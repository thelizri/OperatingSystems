#Operating-Systems 
## Introduction
CPU scheduling is a critical aspect of operating system design that aims to ensure the efficient utilization of the central processing unit (CPU) in a computer system. Its primary goal is to prevent the CPU from sitting idle, maximizing system throughput, and providing a responsive user experience.

## Multiprogramming
One of the key concepts in CPU scheduling is the idea of multiprogramming. In a multiprogramming environment, several processes are kept in memory simultaneously, ready to be executed by the CPU. This approach allows for better resource utilization and faster response times.

## CPU and I/O Burst Cycles
To understand CPU scheduling better, it's essential to grasp the concept of CPU and I/O burst cycles. Processes in a computer system typically alternate between two states: CPU execution and I/O wait.

### CPU Execution
During the CPU execution phase, a process runs on the CPU, performing computations and executing instructions. This phase is characterized by high CPU utilization.

### I/O Wait
Processes often need to interact with external devices or access data from storage, leading to I/O operations (e.g., reading from a file or receiving network data). During these I/O operations, the process goes into an I/O wait state, where it cannot use the CPU effectively.

### Alternating Cycles
Processes repeatedly cycle between CPU execution and I/O wait states. This cyclic behavior continues until a specific event triggers a change in the process's state. These events could include the completion of an I/O operation or a timer interrupt.

## Context Switching
When a process transitions from CPU execution to I/O wait or vice versa, the operating system performs a context switch. A context switch involves saving the state of the currently running process (registers, program counter, etc.) and loading the state of the next process to be executed. Context switches introduce some overhead but are necessary for managing multiple processes efficiently.

## System Request to Terminate Execution
A process's lifecycle does not only involve CPU and I/O bursts. It also includes a termination phase. When a process completes its tasks or encounters an error, it sends a system request to terminate its execution. The operating system handles this request, releases any allocated resources, and removes the process from memory.

Certainly, let's delve deeper into the various time-related concepts associated with a process:

## Times Related to a Process

1. **Arrival Time**: The arrival time of a process is the point in time when it arrives and becomes available for execution in the ready queue. It represents when the process enters the system and begins competing for CPU time.

2. **Burst Time (Execution Time)**: Burst time, also known as execution time, is the amount of time a process requires to complete its execution on the CPU without interruption. It encompasses the time when the process actively uses the CPU for computations.

3. **Completion Time**: Completion time is the time at which a process finishes its execution and leaves the CPU. It represents when the process is done with its tasks and is ready to exit the system.

4. **Turnaround Time**: Turnaround time is the total time taken by a process to complete its execution from arrival to termination. It can be calculated in two ways:
   - Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
   - Turnaround Time = Burst Time + I/O Time + Waiting Time
   Turnaround time provides a comprehensive view of how long a process spends in the system.

5. **Waiting Time**: Waiting time is the total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it gets CPU time for execution. It's the time a process is ready to run but has to wait for the CPU to become available.

6. **Response Time**: Response time refers to the duration from when a user's request or input is made to the point where the system starts executing the associated process. It represents the interval from the submission of a task to the commencement of its processing. In other words, it's the initial waiting period a task experiences before it is first scheduled for execution by the CPU.

8. **I/O Time**: I/O time represents the time a process spends waiting for input/output operations, such as reading from or writing to a file, accessing peripheral devices, or communicating over a network. It is part of the overall execution time (burst time) but can significantly impact a process's efficiency and performance.

These time-related metrics are essential for evaluating the performance and efficiency of CPU scheduling algorithms. They help in understanding how processes utilize system resources and how responsive the system is to user requests. Accurate measurement and analysis of these times are crucial for optimizing system performance and user experience.

### Scheduling Criteria
Efficient CPU scheduling algorithms are evaluated based on several criteria, including:

- CPU Utilization: Maximizing CPU usage to keep it busy most of the time.
- Throughput: The number of processes completed per unit of time.
- Turnaround Time: The total time taken to execute a process, including waiting and execution time.
- Waiting Time: The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.
- Response Time: The time it takes for the system to respond to a user's request.

## Scheduling Algorithms
To determine which process should be executed next, the operating system employs various scheduling algorithms. These algorithms prioritize processes based on criteria such as their priority, the amount of CPU time they've already used, and their expected burst times. Common scheduling algorithms include:

- First-Come-First-Served ([[FCFS]])
- Shortest Job First ([[SJF]])
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin ([[RR]])

### Thread Scheduling
In addition to process scheduling, modern operating systems often implement thread scheduling. Thread scheduling involves managing the execution of individual threads within a process. Common thread scheduling terms and algorithms include:

- Process-Centric Scheduling (PCS): Scheduling based on the entire process.
- System-Centric Scheduling (SCS): Scheduling that considers system-level factors.

### Multi-Processor Scheduling 
In systems with multiple processors or cores, multi-processor scheduling becomes essential. It includes concepts like:

- Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP): Multiple processors share a common memory.
- Processor Affinity: Assigning specific processes or threads to particular processors for optimization.

Effective CPU scheduling is crucial for the overall performance and responsiveness of a computer system, and choosing the right scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements and goals of the system.

Certainly, I'll continue with the additional information you provided:

## Difference between Scheduler and Dispatcher
In the context of CPU scheduling, it's essential to distinguish between the scheduler and the dispatcher:

- **Scheduler**: The scheduler is responsible for selecting the next process from the pool of ready processes to run on the CPU. It makes decisions based on various scheduling algorithms and criteria, such as priority or time-sharing policies.

- **Dispatcher**: The dispatcher is responsible for the actual context switch and the allocation of the CPU to the selected process. It carries out the switching of the CPU from the currently executing process to the chosen process by saving and restoring the necessary states, registers, and program counters. Essentially, the dispatcher is the component that executes the decision made by the scheduler.

## Four Scenarios for Scheduling Decisions
When managing CPU scheduling, there are four primary scenarios in which scheduling decisions come into play:

1. **When a Process Switches from Running State to Waiting State**: In this scenario, a process was actively running on the CPU but had to transition to the waiting state, typically due to an I/O operation or other blocking event. The scheduler needs to select a new process to run on the CPU.

2. **When a Process Switches from Running State to Ready State**: This occurs when an interrupt or some event makes a running process become ready to run again. The scheduler has a choice to make: whether to continue executing the current process or select a different one from the ready queue.

3. **When a Process Switches from Waiting State to Running State**: When a process in the waiting state becomes ready because, for instance, an I/O operation completes, the scheduler must decide whether to allow the previously waiting process to execute or choose another process.

4. **When a Process Terminates**: When a process completes its execution or encounters an error, it sends a request to the operating system to terminate. In this scenario, the scheduler must select a new process to run on the CPU.

In scenarios 1 and 4, there isn't much choice for the scheduler; it must pick a new process. In scenarios 2 and 3, the scheduler faces a decision about whether to preempt the currently executing process and give the CPU to another process or let the current process continue running.

## Preemptive Scheduling vs. Nonpreemptive Scheduling
CPU scheduling algorithms can be categorized as preemptive or nonpreemptive:

- **Preemptive Scheduling**: In preemptive scheduling, the operating system can forcibly remove a running process from the CPU if a higher-priority process becomes available or if a running process exceeds its time quantum (in the case of time-sharing). Preemptive scheduling allows for more dynamic and responsive multitasking but can introduce overhead due to frequent context switches.

- **Nonpreemptive Scheduling**: Nonpreemptive scheduling allows a process to continue running until it voluntarily relinquishes the CPU, such as when it completes its task or enters a waiting state. Nonpreemptive scheduling is simpler to implement but may lead to less fairness and responsiveness in multitasking environments.

The choice between preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling depends on the specific requirements of the system and the trade-offs between responsiveness and overhead.

Effective CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, impacting the overall performance and user experience in computing environments. The selection of scheduling algorithms and policies should align with the system's goals and priorities.
